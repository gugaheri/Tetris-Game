# Tetris-Game
### A full fledge Tetris game using OOPS concept in Python language


This game application is a version of Tetris game. The goal of the project is to implement the basic game play. The objective of Tetris is to complete full solid lines. When you make a line it disappears and all the blocks shift accordingly. If you let the blocks reach the top of the Tetris board, you lose. You cannot win a Tetris game, though you can attempt to get the high score.  

A few of the silent features implemented are:
* Game can be paused anytime as per convenience
* As the user score passes a certain threshold, they will move up a level
* Preview and saving of the high score
* Preview for the upcoming block
